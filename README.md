# 🐍 Python Data Analysis Practice

This repository contains my hands-on practice work in Python, focusing on foundational and intermediate concepts essential for data analysis. The practice is structured through **Jupyter Notebooks** and covers the following areas:

## 📘 Contents

* **Python Basics**
  Variables, data types, operators, control flow, loops, and functions.

* **Python Data Structures**
  Detailed exercises on lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

* **NumPy**
  Array operations, broadcasting, indexing, slicing, and basic numerical computations.

* **Pandas**
  DataFrames and Series, data cleaning, filtering, grouping, merging, and reshaping data.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  Practical analysis of datasets using statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover insights, detect outliers, and understand patterns.

## 📂 Tools Used

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used for EDA)

## 📈 Purpose

This project is part of my learning journey to become proficient in data analysis using Python. It demonstrates my ability to write clean code, manipulate data effectively, and extract insights from raw datasets.
